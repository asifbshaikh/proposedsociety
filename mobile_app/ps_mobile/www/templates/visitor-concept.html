            <hr>
           <!--  <div>The most important criterion and also the major concern for a property buyer is the minimum property cost with expected amenities and facilities. The potential buyer intends to purchase property at the least possible cost with fulfillment of all expected property demand and therefore tries various methods such as; (a) individually purchasing a plot and construct the property (b) A group of interested people comes together who then form a society and develop the property (c) Purchasing under-construction or ready possession property from the builder. These are the three traditional methods to purchase property. However all these abovesaid methods still do not completely satisfy the cost criterion and all the expected property demand of the buyer. It is this aspect, minimum cost, the affordability and fulfillment of all the expected amenities and facilities that differentiates the concept ‘Builder society’s Promoter’. It is such an innovative concept and method to construct property that the property cost can be reduced by upto twenty percent or more than the prevailing market rate at that time with the same amenities and the same location.<br><br>
                Under this concept, we obtain all necessary information online, through the application form available on our website. We ask for the personal basic information of the interested applicants, complete & detailed information about their income, investments and loans in the market, desired property to be purchased, expected location and required amenities & facilities. At the time of accepting the application, as a company policy, while carrying out a survey company does not act as a promoter. We does not reveal information about any proposed building under the scheme or about any amenities, about any title documents in respect of any lands, or about any proposed building plan until we act as promoter.<br><br>
                Applicants who have opted for the same location and the same amenities are scrutinized or called together for a discussion. If required applicants are personally interviewed with a view to assess & understand their financial capacity, and to understand & solve their personal difficulties. Until this stage, no consideration or booking amount in respect of any property is taken from applicants, except for a nominal registration fee of Rs 500 (Rupees five hundred only). In addition, no commission is given to the agent, as the project is not finalized until all applications have been scrutinized. Further, a careful & definitive study is conducted on the demands of the applicants such as the expected location, common amenities & facilities, and on their financial capacity.<br><br>
                Through this process of application scrutinizing and study, a list of eligible applicants is finalised. Before taking any amount from these selected applicants or confirming any booking, the promoter purchases the required land for the project, fulfills the requisite legal formalities as per the provisions of the applicable laws, confirms the amenities and facilities of the projects according to the common demands of the applicants, and gets the plan of the plot of the purchased land approved. It is only after this stage that the promoter takes any booking amount or consideration.<br><br>
                After ensuring compliance with the laws applicable to the project, the company informs individual purchasers (i.e. selected applicants) about all aspects of the project such as amenities & facilities, approved plan, clean and clear title, etc. Further, the company resolves the doubts of the applicants, if any, about the proposed project. Then the company starts collecting the booking amount, cost of land and construction cost when it acts as a promoter. If seventy five percent of the proposed applicants will be bearable to pay the proportionate land cost and if they demanded to form the society first accordingly society can be formed, and the further processing and construction is undertaken as they decide.<br><br>
                As a company policy, we confirm the group of purchasers before starting the project. Then the purchaser’s eligibility for loan amount is assessed by financial institutions according to the purchaser’s financial capacity. As a result, at the time of personal interview with individual applicants and which the help of provided information in application the total funds available with them can be confirmed. This ensures availability of sufficient funds, as per the budget, and eliminates the possibility of financial obstacles hindering smooth completion of the proposed project. Moreover, because the land cost and the construction cost of the project are recovered within the stipulated time period, the interest burden on the project is reduced upto twenty percent or less than twenty percent; the project cost also reduces accordingly.<br><br>
                The entire procedure mentioned above is exclusively carried out under the supervision of an experienced and highly competent promoter/builder having sound technical knowledge and team, sufficient funds, large network in the real estate sector, requisite construction facilities & equipment. This approach paves the way for us to smoothly and successfully execute the project. The property is constructed within a scheduled time, which also helps to reduce the property cost.<br><br>
                This concept was implemented in the year 2009. According to this concept, two buildings have been constructed at the expected lowest cost, and the local planning authority has issued the occupancy / completion certificates for them. The projects developed under this concept have been felicitated and nominated for the prestigious MCHI – CREDAI Award and the CNBC Award and also as the top two projects in India. -->
