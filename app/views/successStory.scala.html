<h1> Success story of the concept</h1>
<p>M/s. Bhawani Vikasak India Pvt. Ltd. signifies a novel, insightful concept—a vision—turned into reality by its visionary Founder and Managing Director. A man of keen insight managing director Mr. Prakash Baviskar, perceived the deficiencies in the traditional methods of acquiring property. Motivated by a vision to provide desired property at the lowest price, he endeavoured to develop novel and valuable ideas to fulfil his vision. The enterprising efforts of this illustrious man culminated in an innovative concept “Builder Society’s Promoter”.</p>
<p>This concept was introduced in a press conference at Vashi in the year 2009 and achieved great success and appreciation from all. Encouraged by this success, the company placed an advertisement in reputed newspapers. The advertisement provided a big and unique opportunity for the common people to buy a property at the lowest value; otherwise, property is usually an out-of-reach dream for the common man. Herein lies the uniqueness, greatness and the authenticity of this concept.</p>
<p>The concept was well understood and in a very short time became popular among the people. Its huge success was vividly demonstrated by the fact that even in the economic crisis, thousands of people applied for property under this concept. All the received applications were scrutinised and studied to determine the eligibility of applicants for loan, and budgets were fixed for eligible applicants. The eligible applicants were then personally interviewed. Based on the interview results, their applications were filtered and sorted on the basis of similarity between the location and the budget, and a conference of only those potential applicants was organised Further, through the company, a plot of land was purchased, and legal formalities were completed for securing the necessary permissions and approvals. The required loan was also secured, and according to the individual choices, expectations and requirements of the purchasers, the proposed houses were planned.  </p>
<p>Most of the amount of the valued price of land was recovered within a limited period of time. Because the loans of the individual applicants were already sanctioned, the builder had sufficient funds to start the construction. Thus, in the implementation of the concept, financial concerns did not pose any hindrance, and projects were completed within the specified time period. As a result, the company achieved a great success in handling over the possession of the respective properties to their owners within time.</p>
<p>By using this novel approach outlined above, the concept achieved remarkable success and popularity in providing property at a lesser price than the prevailing market rate. It is noteworthy that the project was nominated for the prestigious<b>MCHI – CREDAI Real Estate Award 2012 </b>and the<b>CNBC</b>award. This innovative concept proved to be immensely valuable not only to the people but also to our company: The company has been felicitated and ranked among the top two companies in India for providing property at the lowest possible price.</p>
