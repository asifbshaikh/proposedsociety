		<li>	The alphanumerical code given on this certificate indicates the identity of the Agent and must be mentioned in all transactions with the company. The expiry date of the license is mentioned on the certificate, and it is mandatory for the agent to renew the license every year before the expiry date by paying Rs.1,000 (Rupees thousand only), otherwise their license shall liable to be terminated.</li>
		<li>	It is expected that the authorised agent and the trained employee of agent’s office will have to give respect to all the applicants for the proposed society. It is obligatory for the agent to provide complete information about the company and its concept ‘Builder Society’s Promoter’. The ‘Concept Application Form’ is available on the website www.proposedsociety.com. The agent should inform the applicant about all the required documents that are mentioned in the application form (e.g. residential proof, income proof, deposits in various banks, proof of insurance, proof of bank balance, present existing property if any) and other various documents that are to be produced.
