	<h1>BENEFITS OF CONCEPT</h1>
	<hr>
	
	<ol>
		<li>The most important benefit of this concept is the lowest possible cost: The property cost is reduced upto 20% or even lesser than the prevailing market rate.</li>
		<li>Applicants have choice regarding the desirable location of a plot: e.g. nearest to a railway station, mall, highway, hospital, school, airport, famous market, industrial premises, public places, government’s special offices or any specified location, etc.</li>
		<li>Building design and flooring satisfy the applicant’s budget and demands. The applicant can decide on common amenities and exterior of the building i.e., Lift, gym, society office, entrance, parking, water supply, lights, swimming pool, garden, elevation of building, lobby, grill, door bell, TV connection, internet connection, etc. The budget is fixed as per the demand.</li>
		<li>According to the budget and choice, the applicant can decide the interiors of the property i.e., Door, safety door, tiles, colour, bathroom door, plumbing, water tap, tub bath, WC, electrical supply & lighting arrangement , window, kitchen tiles, etc. Moreover, all these will be according to the applicant’s choice & budget.</li>
		<li>As most of the bookings have already been confirmed, applicants can be rest assured that the project will be completed as per the schedule.</li>
		<li>The land required for the project is purchased only after careful investigation of the title by legal experts under the supervision of the promoter, who has sound technical knowledge and considerable experience.</li>
		<li>The value of the land is fixed by the veteran promoter (builder) having up-to-date knowledge of the current market rate, conditions, and the overall market scenario. Hence, the land for the ‘proposed building project’ is acquired at a lesser rate, by avoiding possible disputes & cheating, the factors the applicant is most apprehensive about. Thus, the factors which can stop smooth project execution are properly observed then taken care of and the potential cost escalation resulting from those factors are avoided. This greatly helps in keeping the cost of land to the minimum possible level and thereby helps to reduce the property cost & the project cost, too.</li>
		<li>Construction of the property which is technically fit and strong. The promoter’s professional experience helps to choose the construction material, i.e. steel, cement, sand, etc.; water; and skilled & unskilled labour of the best quality and at a lesser than usual cost with strong technical support.</li>
		<li>With the details provided by the applicant, the budget is easily set and eligibility for the loan amount is confirmed by the experts of a financial institution before the booking is done.  This greatly helps the applicant to save him from the unfortunate circumstance of having to cancel the booking due to unavailability of loan.</li>
		<li>You can easily search for the property from any corner of the world. No need to travel daily in search of property at different locations with different rates and different builders.</li>
