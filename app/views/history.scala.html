<h1>HISTORY OF THE COMPANY</h1>
<hr>
<p>M/S. Bhawani Vikasak (I) Pvt. Ltd. was established on 22nd March 2000 with a special purpose, namely to provide homes at an affordable rate to the common man and workers of the Municipal Corporation, Navi Mumbai, thereby solving the financial difficulties they faced in acquiring a home. </p>
<p>The company’s first project was successfully completed at Airoli, Navi Mumbai. Subsequently, the company even succeeded in providing homes at affordable rate to the common man and municipal transport workers at Kamothe, Navi Mumbai.</p>
<p>Thereafter, the projects for common man, along with luxurious amenities and facilities, were implemented under this concept. It must be noted that occupancy certificates have been given to the purchasers of the projects completed so far. Similarly, because in all these projects, co-operative housing societies have been established and registered; the ownership of the land has also been transferred to the respective societies.</p>
<p>The integrity of our company and the uniqueness & success of the concept is underlined by the fact that all property buyers are satisfied, and the company has no litigation from any of the buyers so far.</p>
<p>One’s own home is his/her most cherished dream waiting to be materialised. However, for the common man, it is a distant dream. It is one thing to provide homes to those dreaming of it and who can afford to buy one with a little financial help, and it is quite different—diametrically opposite—to provide homes to those who never dream of one as they know they cannot afford to even dream of it. Herein lies our uniqueness and this is what makes us one of the respectable companies in the Indian real estate market. Right since its inception, our company has been paying all government taxes, complying with legal requirements and has been free from all hindrances.
</p>
<p>From time to time, the company has conducted in-depth market research with the special purpose of providing home at the lowest possible cost. The company has immensely benefited from the rich experience and vision of its Managing Director in the public sector and business; all its functions are streamlined and well-documented and are carried out according to the established procedures. As a result, the company has obtained the prestigious ISO 9001-2008 certification and is a respectable entity in the real estate market.
