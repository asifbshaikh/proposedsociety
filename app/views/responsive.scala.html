	<h1>Our Concept</h1>
	<hr/>

	<p>The most important expectation of the purchaser while purchasing the property would be to purchase the property at the least possible cost, for which purpose he tries through various methods,e.g., (a) constructing property by way of purchasing the plot individually , (b) interested people coming together to form a society &amp; then construct the building, (c) try to purchase the property, ready or under construction at lesser cost from builder, these three methods are the traditional methods to purchase property. But the ‘Builder society’s Promoter’ is such an innovative concept and method to construct the property, because of which the cost of the property can be reduced up to 20% or even lesser than that compared to the current market rate at that time with same amenities and same location..</p>

	<p>Under this concept, through an advertisement / the website, by the way of applications, the personal information of the interested purchasers, complete information about income, details about their investments in market, details about loan borrowed by them, the details of existing property and desired property to be purchased, expected location of the desired  property, and required amenities &amp;facilities, is collected. At the time of accepting the applications, the information about any proposed building under the scheme or about any amenities, about any title documents in respect of any lands, or about any proposed building plans is not produced in front of the applicants or any kind of assurance is not given to the applicants, because under this concept, neither any booking amount is accepted nor the consideration. Because under this concept building is constructed only, according to the wishes &amp; demands of the customer and not as per Developer’s wishes therefore, according to this concept only the demands of the interested customers are registered through this application.</p>
	
	<p>Applicant customers expecting same location and same amenities are brought together. For the purpose of investigating the financial capacity, and to understand &amp; solve personal difficulties of the customers, an interview is taken. Until this, no consideration or booking amount in respect of any property is taken from applicants except Rs.500/- (Five hundred rupees) as registration fee of application. For all these actions mentioned above any commission is not given to the Agent, because no project has been confirmed until filtration of applications. But a study is carried out about the demands of the Applicants in respect of expected locations, common amenities &amp; facilities and  financial capacity..</p>

	<p>At the end of the above process of application scrutiny and study, and before taking any amount or confirming any booking, the promoter purchases the required land for the project completely by himself, fulfills the requisites of the provisions of all the applicable laws, confirms the amenities and facilities of the projects according to common  demands, and gets approved the plan of the plot of land purchased. Only after this the promoter takes any booking amount or consideration.</p>

	<p> After the fulfillment of all the requisites of applicable laws to the projects, company informs the proposed purchasers about all these aspects like amenities &amp; facilities, approved plan, clean and clear title etc. After clearing the doubts of the applicants about the proposed project, booking amount, cost of land, construction cost etc., collection of property cost is started by the builder. Or if demanded by the purchasers, a society can also be formed and further process and construction proceeds as they decide.</p>

	<p>The purchasers have been confirmed before start of the project. The eligibility of purchaser to loan amount, is tentatively sanctioned by financial institutions as per financial capacity of the applicant. At the time of personal interview with the applicant, the total fund available with them has already been confirmed. Because of which, the main obstacle  for the completion of proposed project, has already been removed due to complete availability of fund as per the budget. Because of the recovery of the amount of land cost and construction cost of the project within the stipulated time, the burden of interest on project is reduced up to Twenty Percent or even lesser than that rate; the value of project reduces accordingly.</p>

	<p>All this above-mentioned procedure is carried out under the supervision of experienced Promoter means ‘Builder’. Because of his various capacities like technical knowledge, funds, experience, huge network in the real estate sector etc., required knowledge and available facility for construction, it becomes easy to construct the property within limited time, which also helps to reduce the cost of property.</p>

	<p> This concept was implemented in the year 2009. According to this concept, two buildings have been developed in expected lowest value, for which local planning authority has issued occupancy certificates. The projects developed under this concept have been felicitated and nominated by the MCHI – CREDAI and CNBC Award and also as top two projects in India.</p>
