	<h1>RULES &amp; REGULATIONS FOR PROPOSED BUYER</h1>
	<p class="subtitle">Enlisted below are the Rules and Regulations for the concept buyer of the “BUILDER SOCIETIE’S PROMOTER’’ 								</p>
	<hr>
	<ol>
		<li>Under the said concept, property is offered at upto twenty percent lesser cost than the existing market rate at that time for the same location and amenities. Therefore, it is imperative for the buyer to pay a proportionate land cost.</li>
		<li>For applicants who fail to make the initial payment of proportionate land cost, the effective cost of the property will be governed by the initial payment made by them; the lower the initial payment, the higher the cost, and vice versa, when we start to act as promoter or builder.</li>
		<li>The area of the property is subject to change (proposed committed area) by about 50 to 100 sq. ft, as it depends upon the final plan approval by the planning authority or the local sanctioning authority of government/municipal corporation. Therefore, the buyer will have to pay the excess amount accordingly.</li>
		<li>The buyer is required to pay other charges such as development charges, infrastructure charges, proportionate charges of stamp duty and registration fee for the purchased plot, stamp duty and registration fee of the flat, society formation charges, deposits, government tax, service tax, VAT, all tax, fee for obtaining no-objection certificates and permission, electricity charges, water charges, consultation fee, proposed government charges, etc. when we act as promoter.</li>
		<li>The property cost depends upon the amenities demanded. The cost will increase/decrease with an increase/decrease in the amenities. If a applicant wants additional work to be carried out in the property booked by him/her or demands additional amenities other than those provided by the company, the applicant will have to pay the additional charges in advance. Additional amenities such as a gym, society office, swimming pool, play ground, garden, area for playing indoor/outdoor games, common hall, etc. will increase the property cost. The company will declare amenities at the time of fixing the rate.</li>
		<li>The company will provide the quotation for the proposed construction after considering the loan capacity and the financial capacity of the buyer. The buyer can obtain a tentative loan sanction letter from a bank by presenting his income proof to a financial institution. The company will not provide any documents of the plot for getting the loan sanctioned. Before confirming the booking, the company will issue a quotation for the property that is required for loan sanction and/or for withdrawing amount from the PF account. The buyer will get documents/sale agreement registered only after paying the booking amount.</li>
		<li>The area which is covered by overhead slab will be considered as the carpet area, and the area which is not so covered will be considered as the terrace area.</li>
		<li>The property will be allotted only after confirming the applicant’s financial capacity to make payment; other than the initial amount of land cost or the amount paid by him/her at the time of booking by way of loan, FD, or cash. For this, the applicant is required to submit written proof in the office of our company, failing which the allotment letter and agreement for sale will not be provided.</li>
		<li>After approval of the plan, the builder, society, or local government body can do the inevitable changes. The company reserves the right to change the construction of building to overcome the drawbacks as it done by the architect and consultant at the time of plan sanction.</li>
		<li>The company reserves its right to allot a property on the first come, first served basis or as per the draw system or according to chronology (i.e. the applicant who completes all the formalities first is given a preference) or as per the company’s operational convenience.</li>

		<li>The buyer is liable to pay the maintenance charges, property tax, and government charges from the date of Completion Certificate given by the architect. In case of any delay in handing over the possession of the property due to the buyer’s problems, the buyer is liable to pay the said charges.</li>
		<li>Once the property is booked/confirmed by the applicant, the applicant will not be allowed to exchange the same for any reason. Although acting in goodwill, the company seeks to provide help as per the availability of properties. It is the company’s sole discretion and not the buyer’s right.</li>
